# Explanation of the DistilBERT Pipeline Code

This code demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to process text sequences through a pretrained DistilBERT model without using the simplified Pipeline API. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Define the model checkpoint and the sequences to be processed
checkpoint = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
sequences = ["I've been waiting for a HuggingFace course my whole life.", "So have I!"]

# Load the tokenizer and convert the sequences to input IDs
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
model_inputs = tokenizer(sequences, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")

# Load the model and perform inference
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
outputs = model(**model_inputs)

# Print the outputs
print(outputs)
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Imports**: The code imports `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModel` from the `transformers` library.

2. **Setup**:

   - Specifies the checkpoint `"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"`, which is a DistilBERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.
   - Defines two text sequences to process.

3. **Tokenization**:

   - Loads the appropriate tokenizer for the checkpoint.
   - Tokenizes the sequences with padding (to make all sequences the same length) and returns PyTorch tensors (`return_tensors="pt"`).

4. **Model Loading and Inference**:

   - Loads the pretrained model matching the checkpoint.
   - Passes the tokenized inputs to the model using the `**` operator to unpack the dictionary of inputs.

5. **Output**:
   - Prints the model's raw output, which typically includes the hidden states and other model-specific information.

This code shows the underlying steps that happen when using a Hugging Face pipeline, giving more control over the process compared to using the simplified Pipeline API.
