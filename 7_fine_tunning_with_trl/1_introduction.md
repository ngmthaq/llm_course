# Introduction to Fine-Tuning: SFT and TRL

## What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained language model on a specific dataset to adapt it for particular tasks or domains. This process allows models to specialize while leveraging the knowledge they've already acquired during pre-training.

## Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Supervised Fine-Tuning is the most straightforward approach to fine-tuning language models. It involves:

- Training a pre-trained model on labeled examples (input-output pairs)
- Using standard cross-entropy loss to maximize the likelihood of generating the desired outputs
- Requiring high-quality demonstrations of the desired behavior

SFT effectively teaches the model to mimic examples in your dataset, making it ideal for adapting models to specific writing styles, domain knowledge, or response formats.

- **NOTE**: Cross-entropy loss is a loss function commonly used in machine learning for classification tasks, including language models. It measures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution of labels.
  - In language model training:
    - It quantifies how well the model predicts the correct next token
    - Mathematically expressed as: -âˆ‘(y_true \* log(y_pred))
    - Lower values indicate the model assigns higher probability to correct outputs
    - It's particularly effective for training models to generate specific sequences of tokens

When fine-tuning with SFT, minimizing cross-entropy loss helps the model learn to produce outputs that match your desired examples.

## Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL)

TRL is a more advanced approach that goes beyond simple imitation learning:

- Builds upon SFT models to optimize for more complex objectives
- Uses reinforcement learning techniques to align models with human preferences
- Commonly implements techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

The TRL library provides tools to implement these advanced fine-tuning techniques, including:

- Preference optimization (training models to prefer better outputs over worse ones)
- Direct preference optimization (DPO)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Rejection sampling

## When to Use Each Approach

- **SFT**: When you have high-quality examples and want the model to learn specific patterns or knowledge
- **TRL**: When you need to optimize for objectives beyond imitation, such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or specific metrics

## Implementation Workflow

1. Prepare a dataset suitable for your task
2. Perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) first
3. For more advanced alignment, use TRL techniques on top of your SFT model
4. Evaluate and iterate on your fine-tuning process

Fine-tuning powerful language models allows for creating specialized AI assistants that adhere to specific guidelines and excel at particular tasks while minimizing unwanted behaviors.
